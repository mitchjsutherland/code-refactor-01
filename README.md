Meeting accessibility standards for Horiseon Marketing Agency

## Description

Horiseon's webpage has been updated to meet accessibility standards and improve long term sustainability. Accessibility is the practice of making your webite usable by as many people as possible. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries, which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services.
